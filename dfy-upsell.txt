THE PITCH (Use on Strategy Call After Main Offer)
========================================

"[Client Name], I want to give you two options here.

OPTION 1: Do-It-Yourself Path
You can take everything we just discussed - the funnel blueprint, the offer structure, the copy framework - and build it yourself. This is perfect if you're technical, have time, and enjoy the process. Investment: [Your coaching/course price]

OPTION 2: Done-For-You Fast Track
Or... you can hand it all off to my team, and we'll build the entire funnel FOR you. You show up to review sessions, give feedback, and we handle all the tech, design, copywriting, and implementation.

In 30-45 days, you'll have a LIVE, ready-to-scale funnel generating clients while you focus on what you do best: serving customers and growing your business.

Most of my clients choose option 2 because they realize their time is worth more than the price difference. Plus, you get it done RIGHT the first time, with my 15 years of expertise baked in.

Which path sounds better for you?"

========================================
THE CLOSE (Use After Presenting Package)
========================================

"So [Client Name], here's where you're at right now:

You have a choice.

You can take the strategy we built today and spend the next 2-3 months trying to figure out ClickFunnels, write all the copy, design the pages, set up the tech... and hope it works.

OR...

You can let my team - the same team that's built 1,300+ profitable funnels - do it all FOR you in the next 30-45 days.

You'll have a LIVE, proven, ready-to-scale funnel that's generating leads and clients while you focus on serving those clients and making money.

Most of my successful clients choose the DFY option because they realize:

1. Their time is worth more than $15K
2. Getting it done RIGHT the first time saves months of frustration
3. They start making money FASTER (and recoup the investment quickly)

Here's my question:

If you could have your complete funnel LIVE and generating clients in 45 days, with my team doing all the heavy lifting... would that be worth $15K to you?

[Wait for response]

Great. Let me send you the agreement and we'll get started this week.

Welcome to the family. Let's build you a money-printing machine."

========================================
OBJECTION HANDLERS
========================================

OBJECTION #1: "That's expensive..."

RESPONSE:
"I get it. $15K feels like a lot.

But let's do the math:

If this funnel gets you just 3 clients at $5K each, you've broken even.
If it gets you 5 clients, you're profitable.
If it gets you 10+ clients over the next 12 months, you've 5X'd your investment.

And here's the thing - this isn't a one-time expense. This funnel works for you 24/7/365.

It's not an expense. It's an asset.

Think about it this way: How much is it COSTING you right now to NOT have a proven funnel?

How many clients are you missing out on every month?

That's the real cost."

---

OBJECTION #2: "I need to think about it..."

RESPONSE:
"Absolutely, I respect that.

Let me ask you this: What specifically do you need to think about?

[Listen to response]

Here's what I've learned after helping 25,000+ entrepreneurs:

'Think about it' usually means one of three things:

1. You're not sure if it's worth the investment
2. You're not sure if it'll work for YOUR business
3. You're not sure if now is the right time

Which one is it for you?

[Address specific concern]

Listen, I only have 3 DFY spots available per month. Once they're full, you'll have to wait until next month (or later) to get started.

The question isn't IF you should build a funnel. You already know you need one.

The question is: Do you want to struggle through building it yourself over the next 3-6 months... or have it done FOR you in 30-45 days?

What makes more sense?"

---

OBJECTION #3: "Can I do the DIY version first and upgrade later?"

RESPONSE:
"You absolutely CAN do that.

But here's what usually happens:

You start building it yourself... you get overwhelmed with the tech... you're not sure if your copy is good... you launch it and it doesn't convert... then you come back to me 3 months later and say 'Can you just do it for me?'

And I will. But now you've lost 3 months of revenue AND you still have to pay the $15K.

Why not skip the frustration and launch faster?

Plus, if you start TODAY, your funnel will be live by [specific date]. That means you could have your first clients by [date + 2 weeks].

Doesn't that sound better than waiting?"
