VIDEO SCRIPT #1: "What is a High-Ticket Funnel?" (12 mins)

[INTRO - 0:00-1:00]
"Hey [Name], welcome to Module 1 of the High-Ticket Funnel System. In this module, we're going to break down exactly what a high-ticket funnel is, why it's the fastest path to 6-7 figures, and the 4 core components you need to make it work.

By the end of this training, you'll understand the entire funnel architecture and exactly what you need to build. Let's dive in."

[SCREEN SHARE: Whiteboard or slide deck]

[MAIN CONTENT - 1:00-10:00]

"Alright, let's start with the basics. What IS a high-ticket funnel?

[Draw on whiteboard or show slide]

A high-ticket funnel is a system that takes cold strangers and converts them into high-paying clients - typically $5,000 to $50,000+ - without you having to manually reach out to everyone.

Here's the flow:

STEP 1: Traffic ‚Üí Cold prospects see your content or ads
STEP 2: Landing Page ‚Üí They opt-in for your free audit/assessment
STEP 3: Email Nurture ‚Üí You build trust over 7 days via automated emails
STEP 4: Audit Call ‚Üí They book a call where you diagnose their problem
STEP 5: Offer ‚Üí You present your high-ticket offer as the solution
STEP 6: Close ‚Üí They become a paying client

This is different from traditional funnels that try to sell immediately. With high-ticket, you're not selling on the landing page. You're selling the CALL.

Why does this work so well?

Three reasons:

REASON #1: Pre-Qualification
Only people who are serious will book a call. Tire-kickers won't waste your time.

REASON #2: Trust Building
7 days of emails educates prospects and positions you as the expert before they ever talk to you.

REASON #3: High-Touch Sales
You can charge $5K-$50K because you're diagnosing their specific situation on the call, not using a generic pitch.

[Show examples on screen]

Here are three real examples of high-ticket funnels:

EXAMPLE 1: Business Coach
‚Üí Landing page: "Free Business Audit"
‚Üí Emails: Case studies of clients going from $10K to $100K/month
‚Üí Call: 45-minute audit call
‚Üí Offer: $15K 6-month coaching program
‚Üí Result: 30% close rate

EXAMPLE 2: Marketing Agency
‚Üí Landing page: "Free Funnel Breakdown"
‚Üí Emails: Behind-the-scenes of 7-figure funnels
‚Üí Call: 60-minute strategy session
‚Üí Offer: $25K funnel build + ad management
‚Üí Result: 25% close rate

EXAMPLE 3: Health Coach
‚Üí Landing page: "Free Health Assessment"
‚Üí Emails: Transformation stories with before/after
‚Üí Call: 30-minute assessment
‚Üí Offer: $10K transformation program
‚Üí Result: 40% close rate

Do you see the pattern?

Free audit/assessment ‚Üí Value via email ‚Üí Call ‚Üí High-ticket offer

This is the framework you're going to build for YOUR business.

[TRANSITION - 10:00-11:00]

Now, in the next video, we're going to break down the 4 core components you need to build this funnel. But before we move on, I want you to do this:

ACTION STEP: Open your workbook and answer this question: 'What high-ticket offer will I sell through my funnel? What transformation do I provide?'

Write it down. Even if it's rough. We'll refine it in Module 3.

[OUTRO - 11:00-12:00]

Alright, great work. In the next video, we're diving into the 4 core components of your high-ticket funnel. See you there."

---

VIDEO SCRIPT #2: "The 4 Core Components" (15 mins)

[INTRO - 0:00-1:00]
"Welcome back. In this video, we're breaking down the 4 core components of your high-ticket funnel. These are the building blocks. Miss one of these, and your funnel won't convert. But nail all 4, and you'll have a money-printing machine. Let's go."

[MAIN CONTENT - 1:00-13:00]

"Alright, the 4 core components are:

COMPONENT #1: The Lead Magnet (Your "Audit" Offer)
COMPONENT #2: The Landing Page
COMPONENT #3: The Email Sequence
COMPONENT #4: The Sales Call Process

Let's break down each one.

[Show slide: COMPONENT #1]

COMPONENT #1: The Lead Magnet

This is what you offer in exchange for someone's email and phone number.

But here's the key: DON'T call it a 'free ebook' or 'free training.'

Call it an AUDIT or ASSESSMENT.

Why? Because audits imply personalization. People want custom solutions, not generic PDFs.

Examples:
‚Üí 'Free Funnel Audit'
‚Üí 'Free Business Assessment'
‚Üí 'Free Marketing Breakdown'
‚Üí 'Free Health Diagnostic'

Notice the pattern? You're diagnosing their specific problem.

This positions you as the expert doctor, not the salesperson.

[Show slide: COMPONENT #2]

COMPONENT #2: The Landing Page

Your landing page has ONE job: Get them to opt-in.

Here's the structure:

1. Headline: Who is this for? What will they get?
   Example: 'Coaches Making $5K-$30K/Month: Get Your Free Funnel Audit'

2. Subheadline: What's the promise?
   Example: 'Discover the #1 bottleneck blocking your growth and how to fix it in 30 days'

3. Opt-in Form: Name, Email, Phone (optional: qualifying question)

4. Bullet Points: What they'll discover on the call
   ‚Üí The #1 mistake costing you clients
   ‚Üí How to create a $10K offer that sells itself
   ‚Üí Your custom 90-day roadmap to 6-figures

5. Social Proof: Testimonials, results, credentials

6. Call-to-Action: 'Book My Free Audit'

That's it. Keep it simple. Don't overcomplicate.

[Show slide: COMPONENT #3]

COMPONENT #3: The Email Sequence

After they opt-in, you have 7 days to nurture them before the call.

Here's the sequence:

DAY 1: Welcome + Set Expectations
DAY 2: Education (Teach them something valuable)
DAY 3: Case Study (Show results you've achieved)
DAY 4: Objection Crusher (Address common fears)
DAY 5: Urgency (Limited call slots available)
DAY 6: Mega Value (Give away something big)
DAY 7: Last Call (Final reminder to book)

Each email builds trust and positions you as the authority.

By the time they get on the call, they already trust you. The sale is 80% done.

[Show slide: COMPONENT #4]

COMPONENT #4: The Sales Call Process

This is where you close the deal.

The call structure:

1. Rapport Building (5 mins): Small talk, make them comfortable
2. Diagnosis (15 mins): Ask questions about their situation
3. Present Problem (5 mins): Reflect back what you heard
4. Present Solution (10 mins): Show how your offer solves it
5. Handle Objections (5 mins): Address concerns
6. Close (5 mins): Ask for the sale

Total: 45 minutes

The key? Listen more than you talk. Let THEM tell you what they need. Then position your offer as the solution.

[TRANSITION - 13:00-14:00]

Alright, those are the 4 core components:
1. Lead Magnet (Audit offer)
2. Landing Page
3. Email Sequence
4. Sales Call Process

In Module 2, we're going to dive deep into identifying your ideal customer so you know exactly who to target. But first...

ACTION STEP: Open your workbook and sketch out your funnel. Just rough draft. We'll refine it as we go.

[OUTRO - 14:00-15:00]

Great work. See you in the next video where we talk about the psychology of high-ticket buyers."

VIDEO SCRIPT #3: "Psychology of High-Ticket Buyers" (8 mins)

[INTRO - 0:00-1:00]
"Alright, quick video here on the psychology of high-ticket buyers. Understanding this will change how you market and sell. Let's dive in."

[MAIN CONTENT - 1:00-7:00]

"High-ticket buyers are different from low-ticket buyers.

Here's what you need to know:

INSIGHT #1: They Buy Transformation, Not Information

Low-ticket buyers want 'how-to' content.
High-ticket buyers want DONE-WITH-YOU or DONE-FOR-YOU implementation.

They don't want another course. They want results.

So when you market, focus on the END RESULT:
‚Üí 'Go from $10K/month to $100K/month'
‚Üí 'Build a 6-figure funnel in 90 days'
‚Üí 'Lose 30 pounds and keep it off'

Not 'Learn the 7 steps to...'

INSIGHT #2: They Value Speed Over Price

High-ticket buyers will pay MORE to get results FASTER.

That's why you should emphasize timelines:
‚Üí '90-day implementation'
‚Üí 'Results in 30 days or less'
‚Üí '12-week transformation'

Speed is a premium feature.

INSIGHT #3: They Need Personal Attention

They're not buying a course. They're buying ACCESS to YOU.

Emphasize:
‚Üí '1-on-1 coaching calls'
‚Üí 'Direct access via Slack'
‚Üí 'Personal support'

This justifies the high price.

INSIGHT #4: They Want to Avoid Mistakes

They've likely been burned before. They don't want to waste time.

So your marketing should say:
‚Üí 'Avoid the 5 costly mistakes most people make'
‚Üí 'Get it right the first time'
‚Üí 'Proven system that works'

Remove risk. Add guarantees.

INSIGHT #5: They Care About WHO You've Helped

Social proof is CRITICAL.

Show:
‚Üí Case studies with specific numbers
‚Üí Testimonials from people like them
‚Üí Your credentials and experience

They want proof you can deliver.

[TRANSITION - 7:00-7:30]

Those are the 5 insights into high-ticket buyer psychology:
1. They buy transformation, not information
2. They value speed
3. They need personal attention
4. They want to avoid mistakes
5. They care about who you've helped

Keep these in mind as we build your funnel.

[OUTRO - 7:30-8:00]

Alright, Module 1 complete! Next up: Module 2 where we identify your ideal customer. See you there."
