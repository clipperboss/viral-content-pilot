TASK 4: CREATE 3 FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM AD CAMPAIGNS

AD CAMPAIGN #1: "The Stuck at $5K-$30K" Hook

AD COPY:
---
Stuck at $5K-$30K/month?

Here's why you can't break through to $100K...

It's not your offer.
It's not your expertise.

It's your FUNNEL (or lack of one).

Most coaches are one funnel away from 6-7 figures.

But they're using outdated strategies:
❌ Cold DMs
❌ Random social posts
❌ Hoping for referrals

Here's what works in 2025:

A simple Call Funnel that turns strangers into $5K-$25K clients on autopilot.

Click "Learn More" below for a FREE Funnel Audit.

We'll show you:
✓ The #1 bottleneck blocking your growth
✓ The exact funnel structure you need
✓ Your custom 90-day roadmap

This audit is 100% free. No pitch. Just strategy.

TARGETING:
- Age: 28-55

- Behaviors: Small business owners
- Location: US, Canada, UK, Australia

AD CAMPAIGN #2: "The Million Dollar Math" Hook

AD COPY:
---
Want to make $1M/year?

Here's the math:

100 clients × $10,000 = $1,000,000

That's it.

You're just 100 clients away from a million-dollar business.

But here's what most people get wrong...

They try to sell to EVERYONE.

Wrong approach.

Instead, you need:
→ A high-ticket offer ($5K-$25K)
→ A funnel that attracts ONLY qualified buyers
→ A conversion system that closes 20-40%

I've spent 15 years perfecting this formula.

1,300+ funnels built.
$30M+ generated.

And today, I'll show you the blueprint for FREE.

Click below for your Free Funnel Audit 👇

We'll cover:
✓ How to package your expertise into high-ticket offers
✓ The "Call Funnel" that converts at 20-40%
✓ Your roadmap to 6-7 figures in 90 days

No cost. No pitch. Just value.

AD CAMPAIGN #3: "Before & After" Hook

AD COPY:
---
The difference between a $5K/month business and a $100K/month business?

One simple thing: A PROVEN FUNNEL.

BEFORE (No Funnel):
→ Posting random content (no conversions)
→ Spending hours on calls with unqualified leads
→ Working 60+ hours/week for inconsistent income

AFTER (With Funnel):
→ Qualified leads book calls automatically
→ Only talk to people ready to invest $5K-$25K
→ Work 20 hours/week while revenue scales

I've built 1,300+ funnels over 15 years.

Want me to show you how to build yours?

Zero cost. Zero pitch. Pure strategy.
